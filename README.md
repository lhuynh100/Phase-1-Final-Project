## **Pokémon BUY & SELL Center**

# **Introduction**
Pokémon BUY & SELL Center will be a trading site to buy and sell a collection of "Pokémon" brand cards. Users can view a collection of available cards with the prices. Users will also be able to upload their cards for sale, and they will need to enter the card's information and a link to a picture of the card. When users successfully submit their card information, a card preview will be shown at the bottom of the screen. Now they will load the Pokémon card on the "AVAILABLE CARD" button, and it's available for sale.

# **Features**
This website has two buttons, and the "AVAILABLE CARD' button will load up a list of cards from the server and display them on the page. The "SELL YOUR CARD" button will let the user upload their card, using our form, to the server for sale. Each card will have one button attached to them. That button will let the user buy the card at a set price and delete the card from the list.
