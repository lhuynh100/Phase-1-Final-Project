## **Pokémon BUY & SELL Center**

# **Introduction**
Pokémon BUY & SELL Center will be a trading site to buy and sell a collection of "Pokémon" brand cards. Users can view a collection of available cards with the prices. Users will also be able to upload their cards for sale, and they will need to enter the card's information and a link to a picture of the card. When users successfully submit their card information, a card preview will be shown at the bottom of the screen. Now they will load the Pokémon card on the "AVAILABLE CARD" button, and it's available for sale.
